# Alfalfa

Alfalfa is an open source web application forged in the melting pot of Building Energy Modeling (BEM), Building Controls, and Software Engineering domain expertise. Alfalfa transforms a Building Energy Models (BEMs) into virtual buildings by providing industry standard building control interfaces for interacting with models as they run. From a software engineering perspective, Alfalfa leverages widely adopted open source products and is architected according to best practices for a robust, modular, and scalable architecture.
