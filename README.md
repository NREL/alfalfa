# Alfalfa Virtual Building Service

Alfalfa is an open source web application forged in the melting pot of Building Energy Modeling (BEM), Building Controls, and Software Engineering domain expertise. Alfalfa transforms Building Energy Models (BEMs) into virtual buildings by providing industry standard building control interfaces for interacting with models as they run. From a software engineering perspective, Alfalfa leverages widely adopted open source products and is architected according to best practices for a robust, modular, and scalable architecture.
