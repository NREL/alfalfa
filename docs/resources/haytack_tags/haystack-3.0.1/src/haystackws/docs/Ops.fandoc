Overview [#overview]
********************
This chapter defines the standardized operations of the Haystack REST
API.  Each operation is specifies the format and options of the
request grid and response grid.

About [#about]
**************
The 'about' op queries basic information about the server.

**Request**: empty grid

**Response**: single row grid with following columns:
  - 'haystackVersion': Str version of REST implementation, must be "3.0"
  - 'tz': Str of server's default [timezone]`TimeZones`
  - 'serverName': Str name of the server or project database
  - 'serverTime': current DateTime of server's clock
  - 'serverBootTime': DateTime when server was booted up
  - 'productName': Str name of the server software product
  - 'productUri': Uri of the product's web site
  - 'productVersion': Str version of the server software product
  - 'moduleName': module which implements Haystack server protocol if
    its a plug-in to the product
  - 'moduleVersion': Str version of moduleName

Ops [#ops]
**************
The 'ops' op queries which operations are available on the server.

**Request**: empty grid

**Response**: grid where each row represents a single operation
with the following columns:
  - 'name': Str name of the operation in the [URI namespace]`Rest#uriNamespace`
  - 'summary': Str short description of the operation

Example of response in Zinc:

  ver:"3.0"
  name,summary
  "about","Summary information for server"
  "ops","Operations supported by this server"
  "formats","Grid data formats supported by this server"
  "read","Read records by id or filter"

Formats [#formats]
******************
The 'formats' op is used to query which MIME types are availble
to read and write grids.

**Request**: empty grid

**Response**: grid where each row represents one supported MIME type
with following columns:
  - 'mime': Str MIME type encoded as "mediaType/subType", these value
    must not include parameters.  Any "text/" media type must be be encoded
    using UTF-8
  - 'receive': Marker tag if server can read this format in requests (client
    can POST this format)
  - 'send': Marker tag is server can write this format in responses (client
    can request response in this format)

Example of response in Zinc:

  ver:"3.0"
  mime,receive,send
  "text/csv",,M
  "text/plain",M,M
  "text/zinc",M,M

Read [#read]
************
The 'read' op is used to read a set of entity records either by their
unique identifier or using a filter.

**Request (by filter)**: a grid with a single row and following columns:
  - 'filter': required Str encoding of [filter]`Filters`
  - 'limit': optional Number which specifies maximum number of entities
    to return in response

**Request (by id)**: a grid of one or more rows and one column:
  - 'id': a Ref identifier

**Response**: grid with a row for each entity read.  If a filter
read and no matches were found this will be an empty grid with no rows.
If a read by id, then each row corresponds to the request grid
and its respective row ordering.  If an id from the request was not found,
the response includes a row of all null cells.

Example of filter read request:

  ver:"3.0"
  filter,limit
  "point and siteRef==@siteA",1000

Example of read by id with three identifiers:

  ver:"3.0"
  id
  @vav101.zoneTemp
  @vav102.zoneTemp
  @vav103.zoneTemp

Example of a read response where an id is not found:

  ver:"3.0"
  id,dis,curVal
  @vav101.zoneTemp, "VAV-101 ZoneTemp",74.2°F
  N,N,N
  @vav103.zoneTemp, "VAV-103 ZoneTemp",73.8°F

Nav [#nav]
**********
The 'nav' op is used navigate a project for learning and discovery.
This operation allows servers to expose the database in a human-friendly
tree (or graph) that can be explored.

**Request**:  a grid with a single row and a 'navId' column.  If the
grid is empty or navId is null, then the request is for the navigation
root.

**Response**: a grid of navigation children for the navId specified by
the request.  There is always a 'navId' column which indicates the opaque
identifier used to navigate to the next level of that row.  If the navId
of a row is null, then the row is a leaf item with no children.

Navigation rows don't necessarily always correspond to records in the
database.  However, if the navigation row has an 'id' column then it
is safe to assume the row maps to a record in the database.  Clients
should treat the navId as an opaque identifier.

WatchSub [#watchSub]
********************
The 'watchSub' operation is used to create new [watches]`Rest#watches`
or add entities
to an existing watch.

**Request**: a row for each entity to subscribe to with the
an 'id' column and Ref values.  In addition the following
grid metadata is specified:
  - 'watchDis': Str debug string required when creating a new watch
  - 'watchId': Str watch identifier which is required to add entities
to existing watch.  If omitted, the server must open a new watch.
  - 'lease': optional Number with duration unit for desired lease
period (server is free it ignore)

**Response**: rows correspond to the current entity state of the
requested identifiers using same rules as [read op]`#read`: each
response row corresponds to the request grid and its respective row
ordering.  If an id from the request was not found, the response
includes a row of all null cells.  Grid metadata is:
  - 'watchId': required Str identifier of the watch
  - 'lease': required Number with duration unit for server assigned
lease period

If the reponse is an [error grid]`Rest#errorGrid`, then the client must
assume the watch is no longer valid, and open a new watch.

It is possible that clients may use an id for the subscription which is
not the server's canonical id (for example if multiple aliases might
be used to reference an entity).  The canonical id is the one returned by
the server in the watchSub response.  Servers must use this same id during
watchPoll operations.  Clients must not assume that the id used by the
watchSub request is the same id used by the watchSub response and watchPoll
responses; however, the order of rows in watchSub request/response is
guaranteed to allow clients to perform a mapping.

WatchUnsub [#watchUnsub]
********************
The 'watchUnsub' operation is used to close a [watch]`Rest#watches`
entirely or remove entities from a watch.

**Request**: a row with the 'id' column and Ref values for each
entity to unsubscribe (if the watch is not be closed).  Grid metadata:
  - 'watchId': Str watch identifier
  - 'close': Marker tag to close the entire watch
The request also .

**Response**: empty grid

If the reponse is an [error grid]`Rest#errorGrid`, then the client must
assume the watch is no longer valid, and open a new watch.

WatchPoll [#watchPoll]
**********************
The 'watchPoll' operation is used to poll a [watch]`Rest#watches`
for changes to the subscribed entity records.

**Request**: grid metadata:
  - 'watchId': required Str identifier of the watch
  - 'refresh': Marker tag to request full refresh

**Reponse**: grid where each row correspondes to a watched entity.  The 'id'
tag of each row identifies the changed entity and correlates to the 'id' returned
by watchSub response. Clients must assume no explicit ordering of the rows.
If the poll was for changes only, only the changed entities since last poll
are returned.  If no changes have occurred, then an empty grid is returned.
If the poll is a full refresh, then a row is returned for each entity
in the watch (invalid identifiers are not be included).

If the reponse is an [error grid]`Rest#errorGrid`, then the client must
assume the watch is no longer valid, and open a new watch.

PointWrite [#pointWrite]
************************
The 'pointWrite' op is used to read the current status of a `writable`
point's priority array and optionally write to a given level.

**Request (read)**: a grid with a single row and following columns:
  - 'id': Ref identifier of writable point

**Request (write)**: a grid with a single row and following columns:
  - 'id': Ref identifier of writable point
  - 'level': Number from 1-17 for level to write
  - 'val': value to write or null to auto the level
  - 'who': optional username performing the write, otherwise user dis is used
  - 'duration': Number with duration unit if setting level 8

**Response**: returns a grid with current priority array state with following
columns:
  - 'level': number from 1 - 17 (17 is default)
  - 'levelDis': human description of level
  - 'val': current value at level or null
  - 'who': who last controlled the value at this level

HisRead [#hisRead]
******************
The 'hisRead' op is used to read a time-series data from historized point.

**Request**: a grid with a single row and following columns:
  - 'id': Ref identifier of historized point
  - 'range': Str encoding of a date-time range

**Response**: rows of the result grid represent timetamp/value pairs
with a DateTime 'ts' column and a 'val' column for each scalar value.
In addition the grid metadata includes:
  - 'id': Ref of the point we read
  - 'hisStart': DateTime timestamp for exclusive range start in point's timezone
  - 'hisEnd': DateTime timestamp for inclusive range end in point's timezone

The range Str is formatted as one of the following options:
 - "today"
 - "yesterday"
 - "{date}"
 - "{date},{date}"
 - "{dateTime},{dateTime}"
 - "{dateTime}"  // anything after given timestamp

Ranges are exclusive of start timestamp and inclusive of end timestamp.
The '{date}' and '{dateTime}' options must be correctly Zinc encoded.
DateTime based ranges must be in the same timezone of the entity (timezone
conversion is explicitly disallowed).  Date based ranges are always inferred
to be from midnight of starting date to midnight of the day after ending
date using the timezone of the his entity being queried.

Example:

  // request
  ver:"3.0"
  id,range
  @someTemp,"2012-10-01"

  // reponse
  ver:"3.0" id:@someTemp hisStart:2012-10-01T00:00:00-04:00 New_York hisEnd:2012-10-02T00:00:00-04:00 New_York
  ts,val
  2012-10-01T00:15:00-04:00 New_York,72.1°F
  2012-10-01T00:30:00-04:00 New_York,74.2°F
  2012-10-01T00:45:00-04:00 New_York,75.0°F
  ..

HisWrite [#hisWrite]
******************
The 'hisWrite' op is used to post new time-series data to a historized point.
The point must already be configured on the server and assigned a unique
identifier.

**Request**: a grid metadata must define 'id' Ref of point to write to.
The rows define new timestamp/value samples to write with following columns:
  - 'ts': DateTime timestamp of sample in point's timezone
  - 'val' value of each timestamp sample

**Response**: empty grid

Clients should attempt to avoid writing duplicate data.  But servers must
gracefully handle clients posting out-of-order or duplicate history data.
The timestamp and value kind of the posted data must match the entity's
configured timezone and kind.  Numeric data posted must either be unitless
or must match the entity's configured unit.  Timezone, value kind or unit
conversion is explicitly disallowed.

Example:

Here is an example which posts some new history data to a point:

  // request
  ver:"3.0" id:@hisId
  ts,val
  2012-04-21T08:30:00-04:00 New_York,72.2
  2012-04-21T08:45:00-04:00 New_York,76.3

Invoke Action [#invokeAction]
*****************************
The 'invokeAction' op is used to invoke an user action on a target
record.  Actions may be used to change setpoints or initiate other
types of configuration/control actions.  An action is modeled a
function which takes zero or more parameters.  The arguments for the
action's parameters are passed in the request.  It is a server local
matter to decide what actions are available on a given target and
how they are parameterized.

**Request**: grid metadata must define 'id' Ref of target rec
and 'action' Str name.  A single row defines the arguments to the
action.

**Response**: undefined
