Overview [#overview]
********************
CSV stands for comma separated values.  It is a plain text format
commonly used for serialization of tabular data.  It is specified in
[RFC 4180]`http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180`.  CSV provides  a simple
way to get tabular data into other applications such as Excel.

Grid Format [#grid]
*******************
Haystack defines a standard mapping of grids into CSV which is used
by the [REST API]`Rest`.  Due to its simplicity, CSV does not provide full
fidelity with the Haystack grid model -- metadata and type information
is discarded.

The Grid to CSV mapping is as follows:
  - First row is the column display names (programmatic names
    and meta is discarded)
  - Subsequent rows map to rows from the Grid
  - Marker cells are encoded as the Unicode checkmark
    code point U+2713
  - Null cells are encoded as the empty string
  - Ref cells are encoded as "@id dis", for example "@3ef7 Site-1"
  - Bools are encoded as "true" or "false"
  - Strs and Uris are encoded using their unescaped value
  - Everything else is encoded using its `Zinc` encoding

Example:

  // Zinc
  ver:"3.0" projName:"test"
  dis "Equip Name",equip,siteRef,installed
  "RTU-1",M,@153c600e-699a1886 "HQ",2005-06-01
  "RTU-2",M,@153c600e-699a1886 "HQ",1999-07-12

  // CSV
  Equip Name,equip,siteRef,installed
  RTU-1,✓,@153c600e-699a1886 HQ,2005-06-01
  RTU-2,✓,@153c600e-699a1886 HQ,1999-07-12
