mlepProcess
~~~~~~~~~~~
A class of a co-simulation process. This class represents a co-simulation
process. It enables data exchanges between the host (in Python) and the
client (the co-simulation process - E+), using the communication protocol
defined in BCVTB.

This class wraps the mlep* functions.

See also:
    <a href="https://gaia.lbl.gov/bcvtb">BCVTB (hyperlink)</a>

Usage:
    > mlepProcess()

   Note: This function is based on the Matlab implementation for mlep. The original
   files were written by Nghiem Truong and Willy Bernal

   Protocol Version 1 & 2:
   Packet has the form:
       v f dr di db t r1 r2 ... i1 i2 ... b1 b2 ... \n
       where
       v    - version number (1,2)
       f    - flag (0: communicate, 1: finish, -10: initialization error,
               -20: time integration error, -1: unknown error)
       dr   - number of real values
       di   - number of integer values
       db   - number of boolean values
       t    - current simulation time in seconds (format 20.15e)
       r1 r2 ... are real values (format 20.15e)
       i1 i2 ... are integer values (format d)
       b1 b2 ... are boolean values (format d)
       \n   - carriage return

Note that if f is non-zero, other values after it will not be processed.
