mlep_decode_packet Decode packet to data.
   [flag, time_value, real_values, int_values, bool_values] =
           mlepDecodePacket(packet)

   Decode a packet (a string) to data.  The packet format follows the
   BCVTB co-simulation communication protocol.

   Inputs:
       packet: the packet to be decoded (a string).

   Outputs:
       flag: an integer specifying the (status) flag. Refer to the BCVTB
                   protocol for allowed flag values.
       time_value: a real value which is the current simulation time in
                   seconds.
       real_values: a vector of received real value data.
       int_values: a vector of received integer value data.
       bool_values: a vector of received boolean value data.

       Each of the received data vector can be empty if there is no data
       of that type sent.

       mlep_encode_data.py, mlep_encode_real_data.py mlep_encode_status.py

Usage:
  > mlepProcess()

   Note: This function is based on the Matlab implementation for mlep. The original
   files were written by Nghiem Truong and Willy Bernal

   Protocol Version 1 & 2:
   Packet has the form:
       v f dr di db t r1 r2 ... i1 i2 ... b1 b2 ... \n
       where
       v    - version number (1,2)
       f    - flag (0: communicate, 1: finish, -10: initialization error,
               -20: time integration error, -1: unknown error)
       dr   - number of real values
       di   - number of integer values
       db   - number of boolean values
       t    - current simulation time in seconds (format 20.15e)
       r1 r2 ... are real values (format 20.15e)
       i1 i2 ... are integer values (format d)
       b1 b2 ... are boolean values (format d)
       \n   - carriage return

Note that if f is non-zero, other values after it will not be processed.
