mlep_create: Create a new co-simulation instance.
This function creates a new co-simulation instance by starting a given
external simulation program (E+) in a separate process and establishing a
TCP/IP connection to it.  The simulation program must support the BCVTB
co-simulation protocol.

    Call syntax:
        [server_sock, sim_sock, status, msg, pid] = ...
            mlepCreate(program_name, arguments, work_dir, timeout, port,
            host, bcvtb_dir, config_file)

    Inputs:
        program_name:a nonempty string which is the name of the external
                    program.
        arguments:  a string or a cell array of strings which are the
                    arguments to the external program.
        work_dir:   a string which is the working directory of the simulation
                    program. If it is empty or is omitted, the current
                    directory will be used. The system will change to this
                    directory before executing the external program. The
                    socket configuration file will also be written to this
                    directory by default, so the current user should have
                    write permission to this directory.
        timeout:    connection time-out, in milliseconds (10000 by default).
        port:       port number of the server socket for listening to incoming
                    connections; if 0 then any available port will be used;
                    if a ServerSocket java object and it is not closed then
                    that socket will be reused.
        host:       a string which is the host address or name. If it is
                    omitted or empty, the localhost will be used and the
                    socket config file will contain the host name;
                    otherwise, this host address/name will be used and be
                    written to the socket config file.
        bcvtb_dir:  the directory of BCVTB, which contains the bcvtb library
                    that the client may need to use. By default, it is the
                    current directory.
        config_file:an optional string that specifies the socket config
                    file.  By default, the config file is named
                    "socket.cfg" and is placed in the working directory.
                    If it is the number -1, the config file will not be
                    written (e.g. it is already there).
        env:        environment variables, a cell of cells, each contains
                    two or three strings:
                    + the first is the env variable name
                    + the second is the value if that env name does not
                    exist.
                    + the third is the value that will overwrite the
                    current value.
                    If the variable does not exist, it will be created
                    with the value of the second string.  If it exists and
                    the third string is provided, it will be overwritten
                    with this string; otherwise, it will keep its current
                    value.
        exe_cmd:     how to execute external processes (E+) from Matlab; one
                    of the following text values:
                    'system'  - Use the standard Matlab's system function
                    'java'    - Use Java

    Outputs:
        server_sock:server socket ID/object.
        sim_sock:   the socket of the connection to the external program.
                    This value must be saved to use in other functions.
        status:     status returned by the external program: 0 if
                    successful, !=0 if error.
        msg:        string message returned by the external program.
        pid:        process ID of the external program (not used now but
                    may be needed later).

    When the co-simulation finishes, the sockets should be closed (e.g. by
    calling mlepClose).

    This function will throw an error if an error happened (e.g. the
    external program could not be started).  In this case, both sockets
    should be empty.  However, if either of them is non-empty, it needs to
    be closed.

    Note: This function is based on the Matlab implementation for mlep. The original
    files were written by Nghiem Truong and Willy Bernal
